		<h2>Baking</h2>
			<p>One of the things I most love is to bake, especially desserts. Below you can find some of my favourite traditional portuguese desserts.</p>
			<h3><em>Natas do Céu</em></h3>
			<img src="dessert1.jpg" alt="Dessert Natas do Céu">
			<p>This is another typical portuguese dessert, which translates to <strong>"Camel Drool"</strong>. Don't worry, it doesn't have drool in it! It has a weird name but it is delicious.</p>
			<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>Heavy Cream, Crushed Cookie, Egg Custard</p>
			<h3><em>Baba de Camelo</em></h3>

			<h3><em>Pão de Ló de Ovar</em></h3>
			<img src="dessert3.jpg" alt="Dessert Pão de Ló">
			<p>This is a typical portuguese dessert, which translates to <strong>"Ló Bread"</strong>It is a cake from the city Ovar, made with a huge amount of eggs, just how the portuguese like it!</p>

			<h2>Painting</h2>
			<p>One of the things that I'm really into is Art. Painting helps me relax and eases my mind. I've been exploring different styles of art, namely Abstract art.</p>
			<p>Below you can find one video of a youtuber I like to watch. Her channel focuses on Acrylic Pouring, Fluid Art Videos, Texture Art, Abstract Art, Resin, and more.</p>
